# Producer Staff Invites

## Overview

Producer staff can be invited in two ways:

- **Registered user**: Invitation creates an in-app notification; the user accepts or declines from the producer panel (or notification center).
- **Unregistered user**: Invitation creates a tokenized link; after the user registers with the same email/phone, they can open the link to accept and become staff.

## Current behavior (before this feature)

- `POST /api/v1/producer/staff` required the invitee to **already be a registered user**. If no user was found for the given email/phone, the API returned 404 "User not found with provided email/phone".
- The UI copy stated: "User must already be registered."
- There was no invite record or accept/decline flow; adding staff created a direct `ProducerOrgStaff` row with status ACTIVE.

## Gaps addressed

- No support for inviting by email/phone when the user is not yet registered.
- No explicit accept/decline step (audit and consent).
- No invite list or cancel/resend for the inviter.

## New design

### Data model

- **ProducerStaffInvite** table: `producerOrgId`, `invitedByUserId`, `email`, `phone`, `roleId`, `status` (PENDING | SENT | ACCEPTED | DECLINED | EXPIRED | CANCELLED), `tokenHash`, `expiresAt`, `acceptedByUserId`, timestamps.
- Uniqueness: one pending/sent invite per (producerOrgId, email) and per (producerOrgId, phone) (when not null).
- Token: stored as SHA-256 hash; raw token only in the invite link.

### API (under `/api/v1/producer`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/staff/invite` | Owner, verified | Create invite. Body: `{ email?, phone?, roleKey? }` (or `role`; at least one of email/phone required). Returns `{ mode: "REGISTERED"|"UNREGISTERED", inviteId, inviteLink? }`. |
| GET | `/staff/invites` | Owner | List invites (query: `status`, `search`). |
| POST | `/staff/invites/:id/cancel` | Owner | Cancel a pending/sent invite. |
| POST | `/staff/invites/accept` | Any auth | Accept invite. Body: `{ inviteId? }` or `{ token? }`. |
| POST | `/staff/invites/decline` | Any auth | Decline invite. Body: `{ inviteId? }` or `{ token? }`. |
| GET | `/me/pending-invites` | Any auth | List pending invites for the current user (by email/phone match). |

### Flows

1. **Registered (CASE A)**  
   Owner calls `POST /staff/invite` with email/phone. Backend finds user → creates `ProducerStaffInvite` (PENDING) → creates in-app notification (type `STAFF_INVITE`) for that user. Invitee sees banner or notification → Accept/Decline. On accept: create `ProducerOrgStaff` (ACTIVE), mark invite ACCEPTED.

2. **Unregistered (CASE B)**  
   Owner calls `POST /staff/invite`. No user found → create `ProducerStaffInvite` (SENT) with token and expiry → return `inviteLink`. Owner shares link. Invitee registers with same email/phone, then opens link → page calls `POST /staff/invites/accept` with `{ token }` → create staff, mark ACCEPTED.

### Backwards compatibility

- **POST /api/v1/producer/staff** is unchanged: still accepts email/phone and creates `ProducerOrgStaff` directly when the user exists. The new producer UI uses **POST /staff/invite** only, so both flows are supported without breaking existing callers.

### POST /staff/invite — request schema

| Field   | Type   | Required | Description |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| email  | string | no*      | Trimmed, lowercased. *At least one of email or phone required.* |
| phone  | string | no*      | Trimmed; non-digits stripped (E.164-style). *At least one of email or phone required.* |
| roleKey | string | no       | Role key. Default `PRODUCER_VIEWER`. Also accepts `role` (alias). |
| role   | string | no       | Alias for roleKey. Shorthand accepted: `OWNER`, `MANAGER`, `STAFF`, `AUDITOR`, `VIEWER` (mapped to `PRODUCER_*`). |

Backend uses the `Role` table (no hardcoded UUIDs); role string is resolved to a role key and then to `roleId`.

### POST /staff/invite — success responses

**Registered user (invitee already has an account):** 201 Created

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "mode": "REGISTERED",
    "inviteId": 1,
    "invite": { "id": 1, "email": "...", "role": { "key": "PRODUCER_STAFF", "label": "..." }, "producerOrg": { "name": "..." }, ... }
  }
}
```

**Unregistered user (invitee will get link to register then accept):** 201 Created

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "mode": "UNREGISTERED",
    "inviteId": 1,
    "inviteLink": "http://localhost:3105/producer/invite?token=...",
    "invite": { "id": 1, "email": "...", "role": { "key": "PRODUCER_VIEWER", "label": "..." }, ... }
  }
}
```

### POST /staff/invite — error responses

| Status | code                  | When |
|--------|------------------------|------|
| 400    | VALIDATION_ERROR       | Missing both email and phone. Body includes `fields: { email?, phone? }`. |
| 400    | INVALID_ROLE           | Role string not in allowed set. Body may include `fields: { role }`. |
| 400    | USER_ALREADY_STAFF     | Invitee is already a staff member. |
| 400    | INVITE_ALREADY_PENDING | A pending/sent invite already exists for this email or phone. |
| 400    | SELF_INVITE_FORBIDDEN  | Owner cannot invite themselves. |
| 401    | UNAUTHORIZED           | Not authenticated (missing or invalid token/session). |
| 403    | —                      | Not producer owner, or producer org suspended. |
| 404    | —                      | Producer org not found (internal). |
| 409    | INVITE_ALREADY_PENDING | Prisma unique constraint (duplicate invite). |

Auth: unauthenticated → 401; forbidden (not owner / suspended) → 403. Never 400 for auth.

### Security

- Token stored hashed; expiry enforced.
- Producer scope: only the producer org owner (or permitted roles) can list/cancel their invites.
- Accept/decline: logged-in user must match invite email/phone.
- No duplicate staff: existing `ProducerOrgStaff` for (producerOrgId, userId) is checked before creating from an invite.

## Producer panel (3105)

- **Invite modal**: New copy: "Enter email or phone. If they already have an account, they will receive an in-app invitation. If not, we'll send an invitation to register." On success, for UNREGISTERED show "Copy link" with `inviteLink`.
- **Staff page**: Tabs "Staff list" | "Invitations" | "Activity". Invitations table: Invitee, Role, Status, Sent, Expires, Actions (Cancel for pending/sent).
- **Pending-invites banner**: When the current user has pending invites (from `GET /me/pending-invites`), show a banner with Accept/Decline per invite.
- **Token accept page**: `/producer/invite?token=...` (or `/producer/invites/accept?token=...`) — redirects to accept flow; if not logged in, redirect to login with return URL; then show Accept/Decline and call accept or decline with `token`.

### Environment variables (invite links and email)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` or `WEB_APP_URL` | Yes (prod) | Public base URL for the Producer panel (e.g. `http://localhost:3105`, `https://producer.example.com`). Invite emails use this for the link; never use backend host or `0.0.0.0`. Dev fallback: `http://localhost:3105`. |
| `REDIS_URL` (or `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT`) | For email queue | BullMQ; if missing, invite email job is not processed; UI still shows copyable link and delivery status. |
| SMTP (e.g. `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`) | For sending email | If missing, delivery is marked FAILED/SKIPPED; owner can copy link and share manually. |
